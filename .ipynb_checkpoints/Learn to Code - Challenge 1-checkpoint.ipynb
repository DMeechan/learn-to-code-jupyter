    "\n",
    "We've set up this notebook with lots of code examples to demonstrate what the tutorial is explaining. \n",
    "\n",
    "Read through the tutorials, edit and experiment with the code, and then run the code and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run some code, click your mouse inside that code block (so the block is highlighted with a green border), and then click the 'Run' button at the top of the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do `SHIFT + ENTER` to run the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you accidently click inside a textbox and it goes into edit mode, just do `SHIFT + ENTER` to close it.\n",

    "**Learn to Code** is split into three sections. Each section contains a short lesson, a tutorial, and then a challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson, we'll go over some core concepts and keywords. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, there's the tutorial. The tutorial shows you how to put into practice what you've learned in the lesson. The tutorials contains an example mini-project (like a VAT calculator), the code which solves the project, and an explanation on how the code works. After going through the lesson content, hopefully you'll understand most things in the tutorial. During the tutorial, we suggest editing and experimenting with the code so you fully understand how each part works. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure about something, ask one of us around the room or experiment with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've gone through a tutorial, there's a challenge. Each challenge is quite similar to the mini-project shown to you in the tutorial. Your goal is to write the code to complete the challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you've written the code and run it to check it works, it's time to test it. Below the challenge, we've written some code to test your mini-projects. Just click on the code and click 'Run' (or do `SHIFT + ENTER`). The test code should then say whether your mini-project has passed or not."
